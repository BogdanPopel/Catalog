# Catalog

Digital Catalog, with CRUD operations.
Data is loaded into the database from CSV files, when the app starts. This is ensured by the fact that the services responsible for loading the data are designed as Singletons.
The project uses the JDBC Driver for MySQL, version 8.0.29, which can be downloaded from [here](https://downloads.mysql.com/archives/c-j/).
